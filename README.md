#  AI and Medical Empathy for Ethical Shared Decision-Making  
 **Capstone Project â€“ Master of Bioethics, Harvard Medical School**
mentee: Sydney Collins
mentor: Litong Jiang  
---

## Overview

**Empathy-AI** is a **capstone research project** developed as part of the **Master of Bioethics** program at **Harvard Medical School**. This academic initiative explores how **artificial intelligence** can ethically support clinical decision-making by integrating **patient values, life goals, and cultural backgrounds** into treatment recommendations.

We aim to bridge the gap between **technology** and **human empathy**, promoting **shared decision-making** that respects individual dignity and supports personalized care in diverse clinical settings.

---

## Project Objectives

- **Ethical AI Integration**: Investigate the role of large language models (LLMs) in fostering value-sensitive clinical support systems.
- **Patient-Centered Decision Support**: Develop AI tools that reflect patients' **career aspirations**, **religious or cultural beliefs**, and **personal goals**.
- **Bioethical Analysis**: Evaluate the ethical implications of AI-assisted decision-making in clinical practice, emphasizing autonomy, beneficence, and justice.
- **Prototype Development**: Build a functional framework to demonstrate how AI can aid in ethically complex medical choices.

---

## Key Features

- **Value-Sensitive AI Models**: Tailoring clinical recommendations based on individual patient narratives.
- **Ethics-Informed Design**: Grounded in bioethical principles from contemporary healthcare practice.
- **Synthetic Patient Data**: Use of privacy-preserving datasets for safe development and testing.
- **FHIR-Compatible Outputs**: Ensuring data interoperability with healthcare standards.

---

## Academic Context

This project reflects the **interdisciplinary nature** of modern bioethics, drawing on fields such as:

- **Medical Ethics**
- **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science**
- **Clinical Medicine**
- **Health Policy and Law**

It is guided by faculty mentors at **Harvard Medical School** and is part of a broader exploration into the future of **ethical AI in healthcare**.
