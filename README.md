## 💡 What is MedEcho?

**MedEcho** is a prototype clinical dashboard designed to support **context-aware treatment planning**. It personalizes medical recommendations based on a patient's **occupation**, **religious beliefs**, and **personal values**.

🧠 Our mission is to empower clinicians with AI-informed insights that align with **who the patient is**, not just what condition they have.
